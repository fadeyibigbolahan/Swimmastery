    about:
      "I was born and raised in Zimbabwe and was a competitive swimmer during my school years, so swimming has been part of my life for as long as I can remember. I began swimming coaching over 20 years ago, starting with the standard National teaching programme and coaching children and adults, both privately and in groups. I came across Total Immersion in 2002 and began transforming my own swimming using the ideas and principles. I then went through the Total Immersion coach training program and opened my own Endless Pools swim studio. I had many opportunities in my early days as a Total Immersion coach to assist at workshops all over the UK. I then was very fortunate to meet Terry Laughlin early in 2012 which led to me training as a coach trainer and having many opportunities to run coach training courses all over the world, often with Terry. During these years of running coach training programs, working with and learning from coaches, and then becoming a member of staff of the company, I discovered my true passion. Having now taught swimmers of all abilities, ages and with a wide array of goals in mind I have been lucky to witness some incredible journeys through the years. From someone swimming their first lap after starting out as a phobic, to the club swimmers receiving personal bests in all four strokes, to successful Channel swims, Gibraltar Strait, round Jersey, Jersey to France, the North Channel and many more. I am very excited to be working with two swimmers who will be swimming round Manhattan this year. Along with Mat Hudson, I am a co-founder of SwimMastery and one of our primary Coach Instructors. Training and mentoring coaches is so rewarding. To be able to be part of the coach’s journey and to watch them develop into incredible coaches and learn from them has helped me become the coach I am today. I look forward to that journey continuing on through SwimMastery.",

      "I have enjoyed endurance sports and different water sports over the last 30 years and have had an especially deep love of swimming in open water situations all over the world. In 2017 I came across a totally different way to view swimming and acquired the belief and confidence that I could truly master this. Up to then, like many, I had accepted the belief that I was not going to be able to swim more than a couple of lengths before feeling exhausted, so it was amazing to realise this did not have to be the case for me, or anyone. The following year, to test my new skills, I successfully swam from Asia to Europe across the Bosphorous channel, a distance of 6.5km in 1 hour 31 mins. In 2020 I was pleased to become a SwimMastery Fundamental Skills Coach, joining this international community of like-minded teachers and swimmers in the pursuit of mastery and the art of learning. My 23 years of dentistry background has actually given me many transferable skills – I am able to encourage fearful or anxious people to experience something they never thought they would be capable of. I can guide people into a peaceful relationship with their body moving through water. My professional training gave me a good understanding of physiology and how the body works so I really enjoy showing swimmers how to practice movements that are going to complement and not damage joints and muscles. I particularly enjoy the aspects of swimming learnt through SwimMastery that focus on core stability and streamlining as they perfectly complement other popular disciplines such as Pilates and Yoga both of which I love. My passion is to allow swimmers to follow the same journey that I have done and I particularly enjoy working with older swimmers, and those with the doubts about their ability to learn, to coordinate their body parts, to become fit enough, to breathe, to avoid sinking, etc. I know they can and pass that confidence on. I love to show them how to swim in a relaxed, mindful and beautiful way. ‘Swim-On’, my company, offers hands on individual lessons in a small pool, as well as a new mindset on swimming. Whether you want to learn the art of effortless freestyle from scratch or you wish to improve your technique to be able to swim further with ease, I can guide you to this goal. We also team up with other SwimMastery colleagues from all over the world to take part in swim camps abroad where beautiful water can be found.",

      "I started swimming as a kid at the local swimming club. In my late teens, I realised that I didn’t really like competitive swimming, yet I found myself highly attracted to the open water. At some point, I took courage and started swimming long distances and simply loved it. The distances became so long that I had to do something about my technique to get my swimming as effortless and efficient as possible. I first encountered Total immersion and it was a great start to the improvement I sought. I was fortunate to get on a development track that has led me all the way to SwimMastery. This has been such a breath of fresh air that it has greatly shaped my outlook on coaching. It has awakened a passion to impart some of the wonderful experiences I have had to others. My first swim coach has since become my life partner! She showed me that coaching can be equally rewarding for the coach and the swimmer. And how the rapport that develops between the two can help so much in getting information across that otherwise could be blocked by ego. Having this deep personal interest in long distance open water swimming, I enjoy taking swimmers to the point where they are able to swim for hours in the open water without tiring but rather experiencing an exhilarating effortlessness. One can be an absolute novice with a burning desire to learn to swim or a seasoned triathlete that hasn’t clicked with the water yet. I am glad to work with those who want to pursue great challenges, such as long distance swimming (like myself), and those who are interested in preparing for competition against others.",

      "Being in the water always feels good. As a kid I enjoyed swimming, jumping, diving and wild dipping in the river, then later I joined the swim team at school and became a serious swimmer at the age of 14, later again I did my exams as a diver (up to PADI rescue), and later again I became a member of the Master group in the Swimming Club of Basel, Switzerland. Being part of the Masters I competed in pool competitions up to my mid thirties (200m IM, 400m IM, 200m fly and longer distances in freestyle) – but I realized that competing against others did not really satisfy me. I was looking for something else…the open water was calling. At that time I already had made some significant changes in my life and decided to become a swim coach. I founded my swim school “swim-arts” in Basel 2015 and started my coach training with Tracey, who is my mentor since then. When Tracey set up SwimMastery it was evident that I will join: The methodology, the knowledge, the curiosity, the worldwide community of coaches and swimmers – all these bonds are helping me to help the swimmers. With my life partner, who is a marathon swimmer, I also could explore the challenges of Open Water Swimming further and during the pandemic winters with all the closed pools I realized that swimming in winter in the river is rewarding and helped me through the difficult times of Covid. In 2021 I opened the first endless pool swim studio in the heart of Europe. Together with nine (!) other SwimMastery coaches and instructors based in Basel, Switzerland, we are the largest cluster bringing great swimming out there!",

It’s so interesting to work with each swimmer to identify how they are utilising their body to move through the water and learn to improve these movements. Our endless pool is a great place to coach allowing video analysis above and below the water, immediate feedback for the client as to the effectiveness of changes tried plus allows tactile feedback from the coach direct to the swimmer while they are swimming. I also deliver Open Water Workshops and Coaching.

      "I began as a competitive swimmer in high school over 30 years ago, and then evolved into an Olympic-distance triathlete in my college years. I withdrew from racing due to injury that prevented running and continued swimming and rock climbing as my main activities. At such an early age, improving health-span became my main value for training. From rock climbing I developed a passion for entering flow state and moving meditation. In swimming I found mindful, technique-oriented swim training transformed my experience in the water. From those positive practices a similar passion for safer, stronger running form and practice followed some years later. I am now focused on improving flow states in long-distance open water swimming and long-distance trail running. From 2009 onward I focused full-time on swim coaching, and following that, teaching new coaches and eventually, started applying the same principles in run coaching as well. To enhance my professional services further, I have completed a Masters of Science in Applied Positive Psychology and Coaching Psychology through the University Of East London. I also offer personal development coaching to assist people making improvements in their work, education, organizations and personal lives. I have an insatiable interest in the physics, physiology and psychology behind moving, learning, training, performing and wellbeing in general. I particularly welcome students who present more challenging puzzles to work on, whether physical, mental, or neurological. My approach to coaching is heavily influenced by the sensibilities of physio and psychological therapists and person-centered theory (thank you, Carl Rogers). You can expect me to be relationally present, to be attuned to your whole person, and offer compassion and intuitive guidance for your particular needs. I love to work with adults, especially adults and seniors who appreciate the need for better movement patterns and have the patience to work on it – including those who have aches, pains and injuries to overcome. I have a particularly gentle and effective way of guiding fearful and anxious people into a more peaceful relationship with the water and with their own bodies. I have a deep knowledge of principle-based training methods, using objective and subjective feedback for advanced performance goals. I partner with Coach Jamee Small in Mediterra International (a.k.a. Mediterra Swim), our independent swim coaching business based in Oregon USA, where we conduct local lessons, group training events, and our adult swim squads. We team up with other colleagues to lead training events and swim camps around the world, wherever beautiful water can be found. Along with Tracey Baumann, I am a co-founder of SwimMastery and one of our primary Coach Instructors.",

Pools closing during Covid prompted me to seek out open water which rapidly became my happy place and as soon as pools were able to open I booked an introductory assessment at SwimSolutionS.  As an older swimmer, the SwimMastery approach using joint mechanics and physics really appealed to me – aiming for an efficient stroke while keeping the joints safe. Within 3 years I had swum from Asia to Europe across the Bosphorus, a distance of 6.5 km in 1 hour 17 mins, completed an English Channel Relay with the SwimSolutionS Starfish team, and swum from Finland to Sweden crossing the Arctic Circle. I have the STA Swimming Teachers’ Safety Award, am a qualified Open Water Lifeguard and regularly work at lakes locally and in London. With a background in teaching, the natural next step was for me to become part of the international SwimMastery coaching community by completing the SwimMastery Coach training with Tracey Baumann in order to pass on my passion for effortless swimming at the SwimSolutionS endless pool in Wraysbury.",

I discovered open-water swimming in 2006 and loved the freedom of swimming outdoors, away from chlorine and having to turn every 25m! I started doing open-water events and loved them, but I had no knowledge of efficient swimming technique or training. A few years later, I had some 1-2-1 coaching and decided this was what I wanted to do. I originally trained as an Occupational Therapist but had to give this up due to a worsening congenital knee condition. I discovered that swimming was great physio and being in cold water relieved my aches and pains. I went on to do a PhD in Manchester. I was very privileged to train for a few months with the Northwest Disability Swim Squad (mainly teenagers and me in my early 30s!), run by Paralympians Sasha Kindred, Nyree Lewis (now Kindred) and Sarah Storey. This gave me a great insight into competitive swim training as I had not done this as a youngster. I decided that teaching efficient swim technique and open-water skills was the obvious career path going forward, so I’m now an Advanced SwimMastery Coach and Level 2 Open Water Swim Coach. I teach beginners to marathon swimmers in a private 9-meter pool near Uckfield, East Sussex, where I can use video analysis. I also offer open-water swimming coaching at WeirWood Reservoir in Forest Row. During the pandemic, I trained as an Oxygen Advantage (functional breathing) Instructor so I can help swimmers and triathletes optimise their daily breathing patterns on land to boost their sports performance through better sleep, a calmer and more focused mind, more energy and better recovery following exercise. I now integrate this knowledge into my swim coaching and often work separately with swimmers to improve their breathing on land.",

      "After fits of anxiety during age group swimming resurrected during mass starts of triathlon in my 20’s, I finally discovered the wide open waters of solo marathon swimming in my 30’s. I realized that I could start swimming places. Just me and my team against mother nature. Tackling the water. The weather. The mental twists and turns of swimming continuously for hour upon hour. Summoning the courage to take one stroke and then another, then just one more. Eventually finding an opposite shore. The fact that I could look back at the horizon and see no hint of where I started enhanced the feeling of accomplishment. I’ve always thrived in a team. Working with others brings out my best self. And accomplishing my personal goals as a team enriches the experience. My team believes in me when my confidence wavers and together they help me discover what I’m capable of. Each big swim leads to loftier goals. Each time I long for the feeling of accomplishment. In search of satisfaction. As a coach, I want to empower people to start. Start swimming. Swim longer. Swim colder. I want to inspire curious swimmers to find out what they’re capable of, through knowledge, connection, and community.",

      "I have been a swim coach for almost 9 years and have worked with swimmers of all ages and abilities. Many of my clients have gone on to achieve amazing results and personal goals; phobics who are now confidently swimming in open water, athletes achieving incredible PB’s at IronMan level, successful swims in Lake Windermere, the English Channel and other long distance/endurance swims. I have loved being a part of their journey. I was a keen junior club swimmer and came back to swimming after a career in banking only to find that I was experiencing the problems shared by many; exhaustion even from swimming short distances! I quickly understood that the issue was not fitness related, but to do with my technique. By implementing the principles of Total Immersion under the watchful eyes of Tracey Baumann I quickly transformed my swimming and decided to share my new found success with others by becoming a coach. I worked as Total Immersion coach for over 8 years.My desire to improve both my own swimming and my impact as a coach has more recently led me to embrace the principles of SwimMastery; once again with Tracey Baumann as my mentor, teacher and business partner at our swim studio in Emsworth, Hampshire. SwimMastery principles of teaching and learning enables faster and easier progression on the path to more efficient and effective movement through the water.",

I was instantly in love with the principles of Total Immersion when I started to take my swimming more seriously as a young adult. The principles of SwimMastery have taken my swimming to a new level and I am anxious to share these principles with every child! I firmly believe all children should be given the opportunity to learn the important life skill of swimming; we occupy an island and water is never far from us, keeping them safe and giving them the chance to feel the pleasure of being in and around the water provides untold benefits for health (both mental and physical).",

      "I don’t remember a time when I didn’t swim. Through my childhood and teens, my routine was set by training on weekdays and competing at the weekend, representing my club and county. Later, I took up triathlon, and while I relished the new challenges of running and cycling, it was always in the water that I felt at home. Multiple injuries led me to give up all 3 sports, until my doctor advised me to swim for the sake of my mental health. In 2009 I discovered a whole new way of swimming and began the process of relearning, with Tracey Baumann helping me to overcome 30 years’ habit and to establish new movement patterns. In 2015 I trained as a coach, of all 4 strokes. Over the years I have learned that my skills lie in supporting others to achieve their goals. I first used those skills in teaching English language overseas, then in training and facilitating leadership and management development, organisational change, and process improvement. As a swim coach I love constantly learning, both formally and from other coaches and with every swimmer that I coach. I have always been inspired by my childhood club coach, Jane Asher, a model of longevity athleticism, who also demonstrated as a coach the importance of taking into account individual differences in psychology. Everyone is unique in what they bring to swimming, physically, mentally, and emotionally. I seek to identify the unique characteristics of each individual I work with, and draw on a range of approaches, including the principles and methods of Anatomy in MotionTM, and Reflex Integration Training, to select activities in and out of the water to help them experience improved access to the desired movement pattern, and then integrate the movement into their swimming. I also use my skills as an Improvement Advisor to help swimmers to take a systematic approach to improving, whether this is about building water confidence or making the best use of data. I mostly coach in my Endless Pool, and offer separate movement coaching sessions on dry land. When it isn’t possible for clients to travel to me, I can offer remote coaching with online video (if you have access to a pool), as well as dry land sessions. I aim to share with people of all ages and abilities my joy in being a swimmer, to guide and inspire people to pursue and achieve their swimming goals.",

It was love at first sight, with the feeling of being where I wanted to be. I discovered the pleasure to swim in a pool and open water with no other ambition than going out of the water with a smile on my face. This method applies to swimmers who are curious of practicing a technique that treats their body with care. I hold a Fundamental Skills Coach diploma. I am based in Basel, speak German, Swiss-German as good as it gets, English and French. I can travel to neighbouring France or the French speaking part of Switzerland occasionally.",

      "Being in the water is my favourite thing. As a child I swam competitively, training two hours every morning before school and most evenings until I lost interest around fourteen. I spent the next twenty years doing a lot of judo and adventure sports before getting into triathlons, which led me back to swimming again. Since then I’ve just loved being in the pool, training with local masters and triathlon clubs. I also discovered the joy of open water swimming, swimming all seasons in local lochs and reservoirs for more than ten years. I have completed many endurance events and have swam in some beautiful places around the world. For the last five years I’ve been a convert to skins swimming (no wetsuit, only trunks) and l love to embrace the cold water. After a long career in IT, sitting in front of a computer screen, I decided to become a swim coach and help others experience the joy of swimming. Whether you’re a beginner, looking to hone your skills or training for a big event, I’m here to provide you with structured lessons to get you quickly feeling confident and swimming more effectively in the pool or open water. My classes offer the exciting opportunity to play, train and experience the water like a master. Whatever your mood, there’s nothing that a swim outside can’t fix!",

      "I have started swimming more than 40 years ago with a technique taught at that time. About five years ago, I was taught by a wonderful coach with a new, smooth, and enhancing swimming technique, particularly gentle and comfortable for the musculo-skeletal system. Having an injured shoulder, for me it was like a rebirth in swimming, as with this very special technique I do swim without any pain. The fascination for this specific swimming technique made me become a coach in 2017. However, improving and refining my own technique is an ongoing. Mental inputs, helping me to perform my movements also in a meditative way, are very important to me whilst swimming. Therefore, my personal favourite aspects in swimming are full awareness and meditative feeling whilst gliding smoothly and gently through the water. The development of a strong body awareness is key in training to improve on a daily basis. My approach to coaching is influenced by adapting my teaching to your personal goals, requests and wishes. Activating your body awareness regarding the movements and results for your technique and speed will be an exciting challenge for you. My overall goal as a coach is to support you and your swimming to reach the point you can feel a deviation from the correct movements and how to revise them yourself. My strength as a coach is to make you aware of your swimming movements and position in the water. Ultimately you will learn to notice the needs for improvement by feeling your body in water. In order to be able to pay attention carefully on each swimmer in a focused way, I prefer one to one instructing and no more than three people at once. I am also specialized to guide people fearful of water and struggling with immersion, by supporting them in finding confidence in themselves and the water. People of all age groups (children, adults and seniors) interested in learning the fundamental skills in swimming are welcome and I can instruct in German, English and French.",

      "Up until the age of 50, squash was my main sport. Then an injury led me to working out in the gym and running. Several marathons later a running injury led me to swimming and competing in triathlons. Why did I wait for injuries to bring about change? I was 60 years old when I completed my first triathlon, now I compete for the British Age Group team in the over 70’s age category. There I’ve said it, referred to my age, it’s like I’m talking about someone else. It can’t be me surely – turned 70!! I am a qualified British Triathlon Level 2 Diploma coach, which means I can coach club athletes in groups and on a one-to-one basis. I am also a Level 2 Personal Training Instructor and a Swim Mastery Swim Coach. All of this has come about since I retired from my business in Information Services over five years ago. I love to coach adults. I want them to experience the thrill of doing something new and keeping fit for the rest of their life, and never assuming that from here on it’s all downhill. My injuries and limitations have always led to new experiences and avenues opening, even as some are closing – that’s life, it has twists and turns. My background is in finance, accounting, and IT so it probably comes as no surprise that I like to plan and need to prepare to give people the best coaching experience I can.",

      "I came to swimming relatively late in life. Although I have always led an active lifestyle it was not until my late 40’s that I started to learn to swim properly. In many ways my journey was largely unplanned. I had rashly decided to enter a triathlon event and only once I started to train for it did I discover (rather to my surprise) that I could barely make it to the other end of a 25m pool. At that point, and quite by chance, I met SwimMastery co-founder Tracey Baumann who was holding a coaching session in the same pool when it was dawning on me that I wasn’t going to complete my event with my current skill level. I was immediately bitten by the swimming bug and signed up for lessons with Tracey. Within four years she took me from a point where one length of a pool was a struggle to completing a swim the length of Lake Windermere, a distance of over ten miles. With Tracey’s encouragement I decided to take my swimming to the next logical level and qualify as a coach. I am fascinated by the methodology of teaching and how the smallest of changes can have a massive impact on a swimmers’ stroke. No two swimmers are alike and it is fascinating to see how something which works well for one person has little effect on the next student. The type of instructions given, the way they are conveyed and the time spent on each one can vary enormously. I regard myself, not as an instructor handing down a rigid set of rules, but as a conduit for information, helping the swimmer to discover for themselves new and more efficient movement patterns leading to improvements in their stroke. The relationship is a partnership and I am always learning from my students as much as I hope I am teaching them. I love helping new and less confident swimmers to improve their technique and take delight in seeing how they are able to make quite rapid progress and come to regard swimming as something to be enjoyed rather than a battle to be overcome. As long as the student has an open mind and a willingness to practice then great things can be achieved with relative ease! As well as coaching, I am a regular contributor to the blog on the SwimMastery website covering a wide range of topics often with an aim to stimulate the readers own thoughts and opinions.",

      "I’m Claire and it is my role to coach, teach, but most of all inspire anyone who visits us to enjoy the water, understand how the human body can get through the water in the easiest way possible. As a child, I was a competitive swimmer, training six maybe seven times a week, including mornings before school and most weekends. I’ve experienced swim tours in Germany, Ireland and competed all around the UK as a child and teenager. After a gap from pool competitive swimming of about 20 years, I discovered open water swimming in 2013. I entered the Great North Swim at Lake Windermere completing my first open water mile, then in 2014, 2 miles, in 2015 I did 5K and I worked my way up to a 10k in 2016. I didn’t even dream of opening my swim school back then. Now we enter the GNS as a family every year and my little people will be doing their half miles this year (2021), 30 years sooner than I did!! This is what makes me happy. Sharing my experience, passion and desire to challenge myself and achieve different things. A change in career was needed for me in 2018 so I decided that sharing my Endless pool with the next generation of outdoor swimmers, triathletes, club swimmers or even just teaching little people to float on a lilo, this was the way forward! Swim Mastery swim coaching is like nothing else offered in the UK. Swim Mastery is a community of swimmers who share professional development, it is nothing like the way I learnt to swim 40 years ago. I spent several weeks learning the techniques in Alicante, Spain over a few years. I am really passionate that this strategy makes complete sense and is biomechanically favourable for the swimmer.",

      "Schwimmen konnte ich schon mit fünf Jahren. Aber das Kraulschwimmen habe ich damals nicht gelernt. Nach fünfzig Jahren als Brustschwimmerin oder auf dem Rücken meine Bahnen ziehend, wollte ich es endlich lernen. Denn das sah so viel eleganter aus als das Brustschwimmen und entspannter für den Nacken. Doch ich kam an meine Grenzen. Schwimmen war keine Erholung und Spaß mehr, sondern wurde zu einer anstrengenden Aufgabe. Also machte ich mich auf die Suche, schaute Videos, las Bücher und gelangte so schließlich zu SwimMastery. Beim ersten Coaching mit Margarethe wusste ich, dass ich den für mich passenden Weg gefunden hatte. Allerdings ahnte ich da noch nicht, dass mich mein eigener Lernprozess zum SwimMastery Coach machen wird. Begeistert tauchte ich tief in die SwimMastery-Theorie & -Praxis ein: Der Mensch ist ein überwiegend auf festem Land lebendes Säugetier,dennoch lieben viele von uns das Wasser. Doch selbst wer, wie ich, am und auf dem Wasser aufgewachsen ist, spürt früher oder später, wie unser Überlebensinstinkt das Zusammenspiel mit diesem instabilen Medium zur Herausforderung machen kann. Wir sind nicht dafür gemacht, mit dem Gesicht im Wasser zu liegen. Wie sollen wir da Luft kriegen? Und was, wenn das Wasser uns nicht trägt? Deshalb neigen wir, gegen das Wasser anzukämpfen. Das kostet Kraft und kann auf Dauer zu Verletzungen führen. Als SwimMastery Coach helfe ich dir, dein Kraulschwimmen zu einer entspannten und effizienten Fortbewegung durch das Wasser zu entwickeln. Parallel hört meine eigene Entwicklung als Coach nie auf. Wir sind eine über die ganze Welt verstreute Gemeinschaft von Coaches, die ständig im Austausch miteinander steht: Per Chatgruppen, via E-Mail, während Zoom Calls und bei regelmäßigen gegenseitigen Coachings und Treffen an Orten, die längere Schwimmstrecken im Freiwasser möglich machen. Neugierig geworden? Melde dich gerne bei mir für einen kostenlosen Zoom Call für ein Kennenlernen & deine Fragen. Oder um eine erste Stunde im Wasser zu vereinbaren. Bis dahin! I used to dream in English when I lived in the U.S. for a few years. Unfortunately, that has changed since I returned to Berlin. But I am more than happy to share the joy of swimming the SwimMastery way in English. My training to become a coach was held in English anyways, so no problem! By the way: I picked swimever for my website & swim coaching business name because that’s what SwimMastery is about: Swim whenever, wherever, and forever, everybody! Every day, if you feel like it.",
